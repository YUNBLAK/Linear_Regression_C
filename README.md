First of all, before training the data using linear regression we need to get data from CSV, but there is no library in C language such as Pandas in Python. Therefore, we must implement CSV inputer to get data and store in LinkedList. Why do we have to use the linkedlist for storing the data? I think we do not know the amount of datasets. So, I think Linkedlist is better than Array to store whose size is unknown.
